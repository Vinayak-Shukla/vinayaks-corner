<p>I finally watched a cult classic I always expected to love, <em>Dead Poets Society</em>.</p>
<p>I have been seeing screencaps and gifs of the movie floating around for years, so I (thought I) knew what I was in for. A straightforward and simple movie romanticizing the idea of beauty, love and romance, in some ways, an embodiment of some of my core beliefs. Boy, oh boy was I wrong (positive).</p>
<p><strong>A passionate life is a life worth living.</strong> Passion is what perhaps has made us capable of doing the extraordinary things we&rsquo;ve been able to that no other species has. I strongly believe we&rsquo;re far more capable of doing extraordinary things than we envision ourselves and it&rsquo;s all because of our passion for said things.</p>
<p>The movie also has a strong emphasis on <em>individuality</em>, and condemns conformity, which is arguably an evolutionary instinct. We&rsquo;ve evolved at such rapid pace precisely because of our herd mentality, it takes a village to raise a child. The movie posits that as nothing more than conditioning. We&rsquo;re not born to just be a cog in the machine that is mankind, or perhaps we are. But if we&rsquo;re passionate about something, if we&rsquo;re able to find beauty in our &lsquo;suffering&rsquo;, we&rsquo;d make <em>art</em>.</p>
<p>Brief spoiler alert, but I definitely did not know how dark the movie eventually ends up. It&rsquo;s certainly harrowing, but I do find some joy in knowing Neil did get to live his passion before the step he took, ever so briefly. It&rsquo;s certainly a sad ending, Keating is wrongly blamed for Neil&rsquo;s death, fired and the system moves on, sticking to its routine… except, the kids rebel. They acknowledge Keating, recognize the impact he&rsquo;d had on them and I personally hope, vow to live passionate lives.</p>
<p>This is what we all live for, passion, beauty, love.</p>
<p>You can feel the passion and love that has gone into making Dead Poets Society, which is certainly a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>The three things the movie portrays, through its subplots are: beauty (poetry and the revived dead poets&rsquo; society; leading to more passionate, rebellious lives of the kids), love (Overstreet&rsquo;s obsession with Chris) and passion (Neil&rsquo;s acting). Something to write more deeply about, someday.</p>
<p>The most intriguing part of it all to me, something that I don&rsquo;t fully resonate with, is perhaps <em>poetry</em> being at the core. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just an indication of the times, or how language has evolved, but I certainly don&rsquo;t appreciate poetry too much. I&rsquo;ve perhaps not even tried to. Perhaps, this is my <em>fiction prose passion</em> speaking. I should try reading some more poetry.</p>
